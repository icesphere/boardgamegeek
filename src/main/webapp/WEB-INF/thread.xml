		<subject>API for modifying collections/plays?</subject>
		<body>Is there a publicly documented API for user authentication and modifying a user's collection/plays? The XML API seems to only cover anonymous data fetch operations.</body>

Or do developers need to reverse-engineer them?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;as far as I know undocumented and hence also unsupported... especially since BGG 2.0 (or is it 3.0 now?) roll out will likely break them all, just hoping the xml api doesn't break too badly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you may want to check the bgg android app which has public source I believe and I think has support for logging plays, for how they are doing it</body>
